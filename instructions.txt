1) Node (+ npm) at https://nodejs.org/
2) Update npm to latest version: sudo npm install -g npm
3) From root directory of repo, run "npm install" to install all dependencies
4) For development, run "npm run start". Then start the flask backend server. Make sure that
the "production" variable in the backend and in app/utils/apiClient.js are set to false.
You can view the frontend at localhost:8080 (port 5000 is backend).
5) For production, make sure the "production" variables are set to true. Run "npm run production".
The index_bundle.js file produced can be found in dist/. Copy this to the backend repo.
(Sometimes, you need to clear cache in your browser to see updates in the js file).
